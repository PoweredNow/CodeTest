PoweredNow Coding Test
======================

We have prepared a linked list implementation in `TypeScript`.

Your task is to finish the implementation of all the public methods:
`each`, `insert`, `reverse`, `sort`. There are different levels, you don't have to
impolement all the functions.


Basic - each(callback)
----------------------
This method should call the `callback` function with each item of the list. (Similar to `Array.each`)


Basic - insert(elem, position)
------------------------------
This method should insert a new item into the linked list at a given position.


Advanced - reverse()
--------------------
This method should reverse the order of items in the list.


Ninja - sort()
--------------
This method should order the items in the list by their `sortIndex`.
This value is calculated by an asynchronous getter function.


Extra
-----

You can find tests for all the methods. As an extra challenge, you can extend these tests to
cover more use cases.
