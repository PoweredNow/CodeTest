PoweredNow Coding Test
======================

We have prepared a linked list implementation in `TypeScript`.

Once you've cloned the repository all you need to do is:

    npm install
    npm run test

You'll have to see the failing tests which you'll have to make succeed.


Your task is to finish the implementation of the public methods:
`each`, `insert`, `reverse`, `sort`. There are different levels as listed below. We are accepting partial solutions as well. So you can send your solution to us even if just a few of the tasks below completed.


Basic - each(callback)
----------------------
This method should call the `callback` function with each item of the list. (Similar to `Array.each`)


Intermediate - insert(elem, position)
-------------------------------------
This method should insert a new item into the linked list at a given position.


Advanced - reverse()
--------------------
This method should reverse the order of items in the list.


Ninja - sort()
--------------
This method should order the items in the list by their `sortIndex`.
This value is calculated by an asynchronous getter function.


Extra
-----

You can find tests for all the methods. As an extra challenge, you can extend these tests to
improve code coverage by testing more use cases.



The Deliverable
---------------

Once you've finished the code test then commit your modifications to your local master branch (you do not need push your changes), and create a `bundle` of your repository, and send the git bundle file to `adam.k@powerednow.com`

    git bundle create <whatever>.bundle --all â€”branches
